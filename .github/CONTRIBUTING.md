## Submit changes by creating a PR

---

Creating a pull request to this project should be a straight forward process as we have created a pull request template which you **must** follow in order to have your PR reviewed & merged.

When creating a pull request, set to merge your branch into `dev`. The `dev` branch is for active development & once a round of development concludes, we will merge dev into `main` and from there mint a new release.

Example:

-   New branch created from main named `my-feature`
-   Add the feature to the code
-   Merge branch `dev` into `my-feature` to ensure you have the latest
-   Create a pull request that will merge `my-feature` into `dev`
-   Follow the pull request template to ensure your changes are reviewed

Once you have a PR merged into dev, you will now be an offical contributor to the project!

Note, if you do **not** follow the pull request template, your request will not be reviewed.
